# Master-Slave-JK-Flip-Flop
Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop in Verilog
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop using Verilog. The Master-Slave JK Flip-Flop is a fundamental sequential circuit used in digital systems to store and manipulate binary data. It ensures correct data propagation by eliminating timing issues and providing stable outputs.

Features
Master-Slave Configuration: Ensures accurate data transfer and stable outputs.

JK Inputs: Combines the features of SR and D flip-flops.

Clock Signal: Synchronizes operations for reliable performance.

Asynchronous Reset: Resets the flip-flop state.
